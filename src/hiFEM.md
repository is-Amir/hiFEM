Below is an explanation of our strategy, followed by the complete vectorized implementation of the `calc_stiffness` function.

# Elements' Stiffness Matrix Calculation

1. **Triangle Geometry and Area**  
   For each 2D triangular face, we first extract the nodal coordinates. The area \( A \) of a triangle with nodes \((x_1,y_1)\), \((x_2,y_2)\), and \((x_3,y_3)\) is computed as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2}\left| (x_2-x_1)(y_3-y_1) - (x_3-x_1)(y_2-y_1) \right|
   \]
   This is computed in a fully vectorized manner over all faces.

2. **Shape Function Derivatives and the \( B \) Matrix**  
   For a linear triangular finite element, the derivatives of the shape functions (which are constant over the element) can be expressed in terms of the nodal coordinates. Defining:
   \[
   b_1 = y_2 - y_3,\quad b_2 = y_3 - y_1,\quad b_3 = y_1 - y_2
   \]
   \[
   c_1 = x_3 - x_2,\quad c_2 = x_1 - x_3,\quad c_3 = x_2 - x_1
   \]
   the strain-displacement matrix \( B \) for plane stress is then given by:
   \[
   B = \frac{1}{2A} \begin{bmatrix}
   b_1 & 0 & b_2 & 0 & b_3 & 0 \\
   0 & c_1 & 0 & c_2 & 0 & c_3 \\
   c_1 & b_1 & c_2 & b_2 & c_3 & b_3
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   We build this matrix for all faces simultaneously by taking advantage of NumPy’s broadcasting.

3. **Constitutive Matrix \( D \) for Plane Stress**  
   In plane stress, the constitutive matrix is:
   \[
   D = \frac{E}{1-\nu^2} \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & \nu & 0 \\
   \nu & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & \frac{1-\nu}{2}
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   Here, \( E \) may vary per element (given as an array), while \( \nu \) is constant. We construct a \( D \) for each face using vectorized operations.

4. **Stiffness Matrix Computation**  
   The element stiffness matrix for each face is given by:
   \[
   K = \text{thickness} \times A \times B^T \, D \, B
   \]
   where \( B^T \) is the transpose of \( B \). This product is computed in a batched (vectorized) manner for all faces using NumPy’s batch matrix multiplication.

5. **Vectorization and Efficiency**  
   The entire implementation avoids explicit Python loops by using NumPy array operations and broadcasting. This is a key FEM coding practice when many elements are involved because it greatly improves efficiency.


### Explanation Recap

- **Area and Coefficients Calculation:**  
  We first calculate the area \( A \) for each triangular face and then compute the coefficients \( b_i \) and \( c_i \) that are used to build the strain-displacement matrix \( B \).

- **Building the \( B \) Matrix:**  
  The \( B \) matrix is built according to the standard linear triangle formulation. Division by \( 2A \) ensures that the derivatives of the shape functions are correctly normalized.

- **Constitutive Matrix \( D \):**  
  For each face, we build the \( D \) matrix using the provided Young’s modulus \( E \) (which can vary per element) and the constant Poisson’s ratio \( \nu \).

- **Stiffness Matrix \( K \):**  
  We compute the stiffness matrix for each face as:
  \[
  K = \text{thickness} \times A \times \left(B^T \, D \, B\right)
  \]
  This is done in a vectorized, batched manner, ensuring efficiency even for a large number of elements.

This fully vectorized approach leverages NumPy’s efficient array operations to compute the stiffness matrices for all elements simultaneously, aligning with best practices in FEM implementations.


# Stiffness Matrix Assembly
Below is an overview of the approach and best practices for assembling the global stiffness matrix (K) and global force vector (F) from the individual element (face) contributions. I’ll also comment on the DOF ordering and nuances you should consider.

---

### 1. Confirming the DOF Ordering

- **Assumed Ordering:**  
  For each triangular face, the degrees of freedom are assumed to be ordered as  
  **[x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂, x₃, y₃]**.  
  This is consistent with how the local stiffness matrices are built in your `calc_stiffness` function (which outputs a 6×6 matrix per face).

- **Global DOFs:**  
  In the global system, every vertex has 2 DOFs. Therefore, if a vertex is indexed by *i* (from the mesh connectivity), its global DOFs are  
  **[2*i, 2*i + 1]**.  
  When assembling, you need to map each element’s local DOFs (in the given ordering) to these global indices.

---

### 2. Global Assembly Strategy

- **Determine Global Size:**  
  - Compute the number of vertices: `nverts = faces.max() + 1`.  
  - Total global DOFs = `2 * nverts`.

- **Mapping Local to Global DOFs:**  
  For each face (with vertex indices `[v1, v2, v3]`), the corresponding global DOF indices are:  
  ```python
  global_dofs = [2*v1, 2*v1+1, 2*v2, 2*v2+1, 2*v3, 2*v3+1]
  ```
  
- **Element Contribution:**  
  - The local stiffness matrix \( K_e \) (6×6) for a face contributes to the global stiffness matrix at the rows and columns specified by `global_dofs`.
  - The element force vector \( F_e \) (6×1) should be added into the global force vector at the same DOF positions.

---

### 3. Vectorized Assembly with Sparse Matrices

When assembling large systems, it is best to avoid Python loops if possible. Here’s a typical vectorized approach:

- **Preallocate Arrays:**  
  For each face, there are 36 entries (6×6). Create arrays to hold:
  - **Row indices:** The row index for each stiffness entry.
  - **Column indices:** The column index for each stiffness entry.
  - **Data values:** The corresponding entries from the local stiffness matrices.

- **Vectorized DOF Mapping:**  
  If `faces` is of shape (nfaces, 3), you can create a global DOF array:
  ```python
  # Compute global DOFs for each face
  global_dofs = np.empty((faces.shape[0], 6), dtype=int)
  global_dofs[:, 0] = faces[:, 0] * 2
  global_dofs[:, 1] = faces[:, 0] * 2 + 1
  global_dofs[:, 2] = faces[:, 1] * 2
  global_dofs[:, 3] = faces[:, 1] * 2 + 1
  global_dofs[:, 4] = faces[:, 2] * 2
  global_dofs[:, 5] = faces[:, 2] * 2 + 1
  ```
  
  Then, for each face, use broadcasting to obtain a 6×6 block of row and column indices:
  ```python
  # For each face, form a 6x6 block of row indices and column indices
  rows = global_dofs[:, :, None]  # shape (nfaces, 6, 1)
  cols = global_dofs[:, None, :]  # shape (nfaces, 1, 6)
  # Broadcasting gives arrays of shape (nfaces, 6, 6)
  ```
  
- **Flatten and Assemble:**  
  Flatten the `rows`, `cols`, and stiffness data arrays (from `K_matrices`) into 1D arrays. Use these arrays to create a sparse matrix with a constructor like `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix`. This format will automatically sum duplicate entries (from nodes shared between elements).

- **Force Vector Assembly:**  
  Similarly, for the global force vector, you can:
  - Create an array of zeros with length `2 * nverts`.
  - For each face, add its contributions at the corresponding global DOFs.  
    A vectorized way to do this is to use functions like `np.add.at` to accumulate values without an explicit loop.

---

### 4. Best Practices and Nuances

- **Vectorization Over Loops:**  
  Using vectorized operations significantly improves performance. While loops might be easier to understand, they can be a bottleneck for large meshes.

- **Sparse Matrix Assembly:**  
  Always use sparse data structures (like COO, CSR) when dealing with global stiffness matrices, as these matrices are typically very large but also very sparse.

- **Ensure Consistency:**  
  Double-check that the DOF mapping between local (element) and global indices is consistent. A small error in the mapping can lead to incorrect assembly and non-physical results.

- **Symmetry and Summation:**  
  The global stiffness matrix should be symmetric (if no numerical issues occur). The assembly process must correctly sum overlapping contributions from adjacent elements.

- **Handling Boundary Conditions:**  
  Although not covered in the current function, keep in mind that once the global matrix and force vector are assembled, you need to impose appropriate boundary conditions (Dirichlet or Neumann) before solving the system.

- **Documentation:**  
  Clearly document the mapping strategy and any assumptions (such as the DOF ordering) so that the code is maintainable and understandable for others (or yourself in the future).

---

### 5. Summary

1. **Confirm DOF Ordering:**  
   Verify that each face’s DOF is \([x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂, x₃, y₃]\).

2. **Global DOF Calculation:**  
   - Determine the number of vertices and global DOFs.
   - Map each face’s vertex indices to global DOFs using:  
     \( \text{global\_dofs} = [2*v1, 2*v1+1, 2*v2, 2*v2+1, 2*v3, 2*v3+1] \).

3. **Assemble Using Sparse Format:**  
   - Use vectorized operations to generate arrays of row and column indices.
   - Flatten the arrays and create a COO (or similar) sparse matrix for \( K \).
   - Similarly, assemble the force vector \( F \) by summing contributions at the appropriate global DOF indices.

4. **Best Practices:**  
   - **Vectorize:** Avoid loops where possible.
   - **Sparse Structures:** Use efficient sparse matrix formats.
   - **Consistency:** Ensure that the local-to-global mapping is correct.
   - **Documentation:** Comment your code and clearly note any assumptions (like DOF ordering).

Following this approach will help ensure that the global system is assembled efficiently and correctly, and it lays a solid foundation for further operations such as solving the system and applying boundary conditions.

# Deformation Calculation

Below is an elaborative description of all the mathematical expressions used in the function, presented in Markdown with LaTeX formatting.

---

## 1. Deformation Gradient \( F \)

### a. Constructing the Matrices

**Displacement Differences**

For each element, let the nodal displacements be given by:
- \( u_i \) and \( v_i \) for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-displacements at node \(i\), where \( i = 1,2,3 \).

Taking node 3 as the reference, the differences are arranged into a matrix \( A \):
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
u_1 - u_3 & u_2 - u_3 \\[6mm]
v_1 - v_3 & v_2 - v_3 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

**Reference (Undeformed) Coordinate Differences**

Similarly, let the undeformed nodal coordinates be \((X_i, Y_i)\). The matrix \( B \) is:
\[
B = \begin{bmatrix}
X_1 - X_3 & X_2 - X_3 \\[6mm]
Y_1 - Y_3 & Y_2 - Y_3 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### b. Forming the Deformation Gradient

The deformation gradient \( F \) is given by:
\[
F = I + A B^{-1}
\]
where \( I \) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix and \( B^{-1} \) is the inverse of \( B \).

---

## 2. Right Cauchy–Green Deformation Tensor \( C \)

Once \( F \) is computed, the right Cauchy–Green tensor is defined as:
\[
C = F^T F
\]
where \( F^T \) is the transpose of \( F \).

---

## 3. Principal Stretches

The eigenvalues of the tensor \( C \) represent the squares of the principal stretches. If \( \lambda_1^2 \) and \( \lambda_2^2 \) are these eigenvalues, then the principal stretches are:
\[
\lambda_1 = \sqrt{\lambda_1^2}, \quad \lambda_2 = \sqrt{\lambda_2^2}
\]

---

## 4. Out-of-Plane Stretch under Incompressibility

For a plane strain (or plane stress) condition with an incompressibility assumption, the out-of-plane stretch is enforced by:
\[
\lambda_3 = \frac{1}{\lambda_1 \lambda_2}
\]

---

## 5. Logarithmic (True) Strains

The logarithmic strains in the principal directions are computed as:
\[
\varepsilon_1 = \ln(\lambda_1), \quad \varepsilon_2 = \ln(\lambda_2)
\]
Since the material is incompressible (volume preservation), the third (out-of-plane) strain is:
\[
\varepsilon_3 = -\left(\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2\right)
\]

An effective strain measure, denoted as \(\bar{\varepsilon}\), is defined by:
\[
\bar{\varepsilon} = \sqrt{\varepsilon_1^2 + \varepsilon_2^2 + \varepsilon_3^2 - \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2 - \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_3 - \varepsilon_2 \varepsilon_3}
\]

---

## 6. Ogden Hyperelastic Energy

The Ogden-type hyperelastic energy per unit reference area is composed of two terms with parameters \(\mu_1, \alpha_1\) and \(\mu_2, \alpha_2\), respectively. It is given by:

\[
W = \frac{2 \mu_2}{\alpha_2^2} \left( \lambda_1^{\alpha_2} + \lambda_2^{\alpha_2} + \lambda_3^{\alpha_2} - 3 \right)+ \frac{2 \mu_1}{\alpha_1^2} \left( \lambda_1^{\alpha_1} + \lambda_2^{\alpha_1} + \lambda_3^{\alpha_1} - 3 \right)
\]

---

## 7. Principal Stresses

The principal stresses are computed from the difference in the contributions of the stretches. They are defined as follows:

**First Principal Stress**
\[
\sigma_{11} = \frac{2 \mu_2}{\alpha_2} \left( \lambda_1^{\alpha_2} - \lambda_3^{\alpha_2} \right) + \frac{2 \mu_1}{\alpha_1} \left( \lambda_1^{\alpha_1} - \lambda_3^{\alpha_1} \right)
\]

**Second Principal Stress**
\[
\sigma_{22} = \frac{2 \mu_2}{\alpha_2} \left( \lambda_2^{\alpha_2} - \lambda_3^{\alpha_2} \right) + \frac{2 \mu_1}{\alpha_1} \left( \lambda_2^{\alpha_1} - \lambda_3^{\alpha_1} \right)
\]

An effective (or combined) stress measure is then computed as:
\[
\bar{\sigma} = \sqrt{\sigma_{11}^2 + \sigma_{22}^2 - \sigma_{11} \sigma_{22}}
\]

---

## 8. effective secant modulus \( E^{hat} \)
### linear‐elastic strain energy density
For an isotropic, linear‐elastic material the strain (or elastic) energy density (per unit volume) is given by

\[
W = \frac{1}{2}\,\sigma_{ij}\,\epsilon_{ij}\,,
\]

where the Cauchy stress tensor \(\sigma_{ij}\) is related to the small (infinitesimal) strain tensor \(\epsilon_{ij}\) by Hooke’s law:

\[
\sigma_{ij} = \lambda\,\delta_{ij}\,\epsilon_{kk} + 2\mu\,\epsilon_{ij}\,,
\]

with \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\) being the Lamé constants. In a coordinate system aligned with the principal directions of deformation the strain tensor is diagonal with components
\[
\epsilon_{11}=\epsilon_1,\quad \epsilon_{22}=\epsilon_2,\quad \epsilon_{33}=\epsilon_3\,,
\]
and all off-diagonal terms vanish. Then the corresponding normal stresses become
\[
\sigma_{ii} = \lambda\,(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3) + 2\mu\,\epsilon_i\quad (i=1,2,3)\,.
\]

Substituting into the energy density expression we have

\[
\begin{aligned}
W &= \frac{1}{2}\,\Bigl[\sigma_{11}\,\epsilon_1 + \sigma_{22}\,\epsilon_2 + \sigma_{33}\,\epsilon_3\Bigr] \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\Bigl\{ \Bigl[\lambda\,(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3) + 2\mu\,\epsilon_1\Bigr]\epsilon_1 + \Bigl[\lambda\,(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3) + 2\mu\,\epsilon_2\Bigr]\epsilon_2 \\
&\quad\quad\quad + \Bigl[\lambda\,(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3) + 2\mu\,\epsilon_3\Bigr]\epsilon_3\Bigr\} \\
&=\frac{\lambda}{2}\,(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3)^2 + \mu\,(\epsilon_1^2+\epsilon_2^2+\epsilon_3^2)\,.
\end{aligned}
\]

This is the elastic energy density expressed in terms of the three principal (small) strains. (In a fully three‐dimensional deformation, the principal strains can be identified with the linearized strains \(\epsilon_i \approx \lambda_i - 1\) where \(\lambda_i\) are the principal stretches.)

An equivalent expression in terms of Young’s modulus \(E\) and Poisson’s ratio \(\nu\) is obtained by recalling that

\[
\lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}\quad\text{and}\quad \mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}\,,
\]

so that

\[
W = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}(\epsilon_1^2+\epsilon_2^2+\epsilon_3^2) + \frac{E\nu}{2(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3)^2\,.
\]

Note that \(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3)\) is always zero for incompressible materials (our case) and the energy density simplifies to

\[
W = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}(\epsilon_1^2+\epsilon_2^2+\epsilon_3^2)\,.
\]

From this expression we can identify the elastic moduli as
\[
E = \frac{2W(1+\nu)}{\epsilon_1^2+\epsilon_2^2+\epsilon_3^2}\quad
\]
Here we put the ogden hyperelastic energy density \(W\) to get the tangent modulus \(E\).

### Hollman material modeling
The `calculate_stretches_update_E_thickness` function determines the material's effective stiffness (`E`) for each element based on its current deformation state, using a chosen hyperelastic model.

1.  **Deformation:** The deformation gradient $F$ is calculated, mapping the element's current 2D shape (`undeformed`) to its target unfolded shape (`deformed`).
2.  **Stretches:** Principal stretches $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are found from the eigenvalues of the right Cauchy-Green tensor $C = F^T F$. The out-of-plane stretch $\lambda_3$ is calculated assuming incompressibility: $\lambda_3 = 1 / (\lambda_1 \lambda_2)$.
3.  **Logarithmic Strains:** Principal logarithmic strains are calculated: $\epsilon_i = \ln(\lambda_i)$. $\epsilon_3$ is set as $-(\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2)$.

4.  **Material Model Application:**

    * **Ogden (Existing in original Python):**
        * Uses a strain energy density function $W(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)$.
        * The effective modulus $E$ is derived relating the energy $W$ to an equivalent linear elastic energy.
        * Principal stresses $\sigma_{11}, \sigma_{22}$ are derived from $W$.
        * Equivalent stress $\sigma_{\text{bar}} = \sqrt{\sigma_{11}^2 + \sigma_{22}^2 - \sigma_{11} \sigma_{22}}$.

    * **Hollman (Added):**
        * Calculates a specific equivalent strain:
            $$\epsilon_{\text{bar, Hollman}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2 + \epsilon_3^2}$$
        * Defines the equivalent stress directly from this strain using the Hollman power laws:
            $$\sigma_{\text{bar}} = k_1 (\epsilon_{\text{bar, Hollman}})^{n_1} + k_2 (\epsilon_{\text{bar, Hollman}})^{n_2}$$
        * Calculates the effective tangent modulus $E$ as the secant modulus from the Hollman curve (handling potential division by zero):
            $$E = \frac{\sigma_{\text{bar}}}{\epsilon_{\text{bar, Hollman}}}$$

5.  **Output:** The function returns the calculated $E$, the updated element `thickness` based on $\lambda_3$, and an array containing strains and the model-specific equivalent stress $\sigma_{\text{bar}}$.
